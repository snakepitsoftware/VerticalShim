# Vertical Shim

RapidWeaver stack that puts some vertical spacing on the page.  
The vertical spacing can be specified in

### Absolute Lengths

* px - pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)

  Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.
* pt - points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
* pc - picas (1pc = 12 pt)
* in - inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
* mm - millimeters
* cm - centimeters

### Relative Lengths

* % - Relative to the parent element
* em - Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)

This list of units isn't complete yet. I picked the ones I felt were most common. I'll add the others later.
